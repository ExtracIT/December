1) when I go to my December repo, then I see there are 7 contributers listed.
Since this is my local fork, how the other members are also consider as contributers on my Fork repo?

2) I create a new repo called January and trying to push all my local data to this repository (the data on my local folder has lots of local changes)
 - when I tried below process, it didn't work... Am I missing something on the below process?

  - New repo "January" was created from UI
  - git add . 
  - git commit -m ""
  - git push origin master
  - message displayed "it is already up to date"
  - when I chech January repo from UI, nothing was updated there.
